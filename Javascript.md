## JavaScript

JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language primarily used for web development. It allows developers
to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites. JavaScript is an essential component of modern web development,
and it runs in web browsers, making it a client-side scripting language.

### Key Features of JavaScript

1. **Highly Versatile**: JavaScript can be used for a wide range of applications, not just web development. It can be
   used for server-side development (Node.js), desktop applications (Electron), and even mobile app development (React
   Native).

2. **Interactivity**: JavaScript enables the creation of interactive elements on web pages. Developers can add features
   like forms, buttons, sliders, and more to enhance user engagement.

3. **Asynchronous Programming**: JavaScript supports asynchronous programming, allowing tasks to run concurrently
   without blocking the main execution thread. This is crucial for handling tasks like making API requests without
   freezing the user interface.

4. **Cross-browser Compatibility**: JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers, making it a reliable choice for
   web development. Modern JavaScript (ES6 and beyond) has standardized many features, reducing compatibility issues.

5. **Object-Oriented**: JavaScript is an object-oriented language, allowing developers to create and manipulate objects
   easily. This makes it suitable for modeling real-world entities in code.

6. **Dynamic Typing**: JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning variable types are determined at runtime. This provides
   flexibility but requires careful coding to avoid type-related issues.

7. **First-class Functions**: JavaScript treats functions as first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to
   variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. This functional programming capability is powerful
   for creating clean and reusable code.

8. **Closures**: JavaScript supports closures, which are functions that can remember and access their outer scope's
   variables even after the outer function has finished executing. Closures are useful for encapsulation and data
   privacy.

9. **DOM Manipulation**: JavaScript can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), allowing developers to change the
   content and structure of web pages dynamically. This is crucial for building interactive web applications.

10. **Community and Libraries**: JavaScript has a vast and active developer community, with a rich ecosystem of
    libraries and frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) that simplify web development tasks.

11. **Security**: While JavaScript is powerful, it also comes with security concerns, particularly in web development.
    Developers must be cautious about preventing cross-site scripting (XSS) and other security vulnerabilities.

In summary, JavaScript is a versatile, widely-supported programming language known for its ability to create interactive
and dynamic web applications. Its features, such as asynchronicity, object-oriented nature, and DOM manipulation, make
it a crucial tool in modern web development.

## Understanding `==` vs `===`

JavaScript provides two distinct operators for comparing values: `==` (equality operator) and `===` (strict equality
operator). While both serve the purpose of comparing two values, they differ significantly in how they perform the
comparison.

#### The `==` Operator (Equality)

- **Type Coercion**: The `==` operator compares the equality of two values after converting them to a common type. This
  process, known as type coercion, can lead to unexpected results if you're not familiar with the rules of conversion.

- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  0 == '0'; // true, because '0' is coerced to 0 before comparison
  1 == true; // true, because true is coerced to 1 before comparison
  ```

- **Use Case**: It's useful when you know the types of values being compared and you want a more lenient comparison.

#### The `===` Operator (Strict Equality)

- **No Type Coercion**: Unlike `==`, the `===` operator does not perform type coercion. If the types of the two values
  are different, the comparison will immediately return false.

- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  0 === '0'; // false, because no type coercion is performed
  1 === true; // false, because the types are different (number vs boolean)
  ```

- **Use Case**: Recommended for most comparisons to avoid unexpected results due to type coercion. It ensures that the
  values being compared are of the same type, providing a more predictable and safe way to compare values in JavaScript.

#### Key Differences

1. **Type Coercion**: `==` performs type coercion; `===` does not.
2. **Strictness**: `===` is stricter, requiring both value and type to be the same.
3. **Predictability**: `===` provides more predictable comparisons, avoiding the surprises of type coercion.
4. **Performance**: `===` can be slightly faster in some JavaScript engines since it doesn't need to spend time on type
   coercion. However, this performance difference is generally negligible in most applications.

Choosing between `==` and `===` depends on your specific needs. If you need a comparison that takes into account the
type of the values, or if you're working in a context where type coercion could lead to errors, `===` is the safer
choice. On the other hand, `==` might be useful in situations where you're dealing with values that may come in
different types but you consider them equal if their coerced value is the same.

## Closures

A closure in JavaScript is a powerful and fundamental concept where a function is able to remember and access its
lexical scope even when that function is executing outside its original scope. In simpler terms, a closure gives you
access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. This mechanism allows for powerful programming patterns such
as module creation, currying, and function factories.

#### How Closures Work

- **Scope Retention**: When functions in JavaScript are created, they retain access to the scope in which they were
  created. This is true even if the function is executed in a different scope.

- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  function createGreeting(greetingPrefix) {
    return function(name) {
      return `${greetingPrefix}, ${name}!`;
    };
  }

  const greetHello = createGreeting("Hello");
  console.log(greetHello("Alice")); // Output: "Hello, Alice!"
  ```

In this example, `createGreeting` is a function that returns a new function. The inner function has access to
the `greetingPrefix` variable of the outer `createGreeting` function, even after `createGreeting` has finished
execution. This is a closure in action.

#### Why Closures are Useful

- **Data Encapsulation**: Closures allow for private variables that can't be accessed from outside the function. This
  creates a form of data encapsulation, protecting variables from being accessed or modified directly.

- **Function Factories**: As seen in the example above, closures can be used to create functions based on certain
  parameters, allowing for dynamic function generation.

- **Maintaining State**: Closures can maintain state between function calls without relying on global variables or
  modifying the object's properties directly.

#### Key Points

1. **Scope Access**: Inner functions have access to the variables of outer functions.
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Closures can lead to efficient use of memory by retaining only what is necessary from the
   outer scope.
3. **Modular Code**: Helps in creating more modular and maintainable code by encapsulating logic and state.

Closures are a cornerstone of JavaScript programming, enabling developers to write more modular, maintainable, and
expressive code. By understanding and leveraging closures, you can create more sophisticated and powerful JavaScript
applications.

### Advanced Uses

Beyond the basics, closures enable several advanced programming techniques and patterns in JavaScript. Let's delve into
some of these uses to further illustrate the power of closures.

#### Currying

Currying is a functional programming technique where a function that takes multiple arguments is transformed into a
sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. Closures are essential for implementing currying in JavaScript.

- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  function multiply(a) {
    return function(b) {
      return a * b;
    };
  }

  const double = multiply(2);
  console.log(double(5)); // Output: 10
  ```

In this example, `multiply` returns a closure that remembers the value of `a`. `double` is effectively a function that
multiplies its input by 2, demonstrating how closures can be used to create partially applied functions through
currying.

#### Memoization

Memoization is an optimization technique that involves caching the results of expensive function calls and returning the
cached result when the same inputs occur again. Closures are used to encapsulate the cache in a way that it's accessible
only to the function.

- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  function memoizeFactorial() {
    const cache = {};
    return function factorial(n) {
      if (n in cache) {
        return cache[n];
      } else {
        let result = n <= 1 ? 1 : n * factorial(n - 1);
        cache[n] = result;
        return result;
      }
    };
  }

  const factorial = memoizeFactorial();
  console.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120
  console.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120 (retrieved from cache)
  ```

This example shows how closures enable memoization by retaining access to the `cache` object, improving performance for
repeated calls with the same arguments.

#### Module Pattern

The module pattern utilizes closures to create private and public sections within a module. This pattern is useful for
organizing code into self-contained units with private internal state and public interfaces.

- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  const counterModule = (function() {
    let count = 0; // Private variable
    return {
      increment() {
        count++;
        return count;
      },
      decrement() {
        count--;
        return count;
      },
      getCount() {
        return count;
      }
    };
  })();

  console.log(counterModule.getCount()); // Output: 0
  counterModule.increment();
  console.log(counterModule.getCount()); // Output: 1
  ```

In this module pattern example, `count` is a private variable accessible only through the public
functions `increment`, `decrement`, and `getCount`. This encapsulation is made possible through closures.

### Conclusion on Advanced Closure Concepts

Closures in JavaScript are not just a fundamental concept; they are a powerful tool that enables sophisticated
programming patterns and techniques. From currying and memoization to creating modules with private state, closures
offer a wide range of possibilities for organizing and optimizing JavaScript code. Understanding closures is crucial for
any JavaScript developer aiming to write efficient, clean, and maintainable code.

## Hoisting

Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing
scope before code execution. Despite how it's often explained, hoisting doesn't physically relocate the code. Instead,
it's a behavior of how the JavaScript interpreter looks ahead to find all variable and function declarations and hoists
them to the top of their respective scopes during the compilation phase. This means that variables and functions can be
used before they are declared in the code.

#### How Variable Hoisting Works

1. **`var` Declarations**: Variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top of their function or global scope and
   initialized with `undefined`.

- **Example**:

 ```javascript
    console.log(myVar); // Output: undefined
var myVar = 'Hello, World!';
 ```

In this case, `myVar` is hoisted and initialized as `undefined`, which is why it doesn't throw a ReferenceError but
outputs `undefined`.

2. **`let` and `const` Declarations**: Variables declared with `let` and `const` are also hoisted but not initialized.
   They are in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until the declaration is encountered.

- **Example**:

 ```javascript
    console.log(myLet); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'myLet' before initialization
let myLet = 'Hello, World!';
 ```

Here, `myLet` is hoisted but accessing it before its declaration results in a ReferenceError due to the temporal dead
zone.

#### How Function Hoisting Works

1. **Function Declarations**: Are hoisted to the top of their containing scope, along with their definitions.

- **Example**:

 ```javascript
    console.log(greet('Alice')); // Output: Hello, Alice!

function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
 ```

In this case, the function `greet` is fully hoisted, allowing it to be called before its declaration in the code.

2. **Function Expressions**: Behave according to the variable hoisting rules. If a function expression is assigned to
   a `var`, the variable is hoisted but not the function definition. If it's assigned to a `let` or `const`, it's in the
   temporal dead zone.

- **Example with `var`**:

 ```javascript
    console.log(greetVar); // Output: undefined
var greetVar = function (name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};
 ```

- **Example with `let`**:

 ```javascript
    console.log(greetLet); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'greetLet' before initialization
let greetLet = function (name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};
 ```

#### Key Points to Remember

- **Initialization**: Only declarations are hoisted, not initializations.
- **Scope**: Hoisting occurs within the scope (global, function, block) of the declaration.
- **Best Practice**: To avoid confusion caused by hoisting, it's considered best practice to declare all variables and
  functions at the top of their scope.

Hoisting is a unique behavior of JavaScript execution, where the interpreter moves variable and function declarations to
the top of their scope before code execution. This allows variables and functions to be used before they are explicitly
defined in the code. Understanding hoisting is crucial for debugging unexpected behaviors and writing predictable
JavaScript code.

## `this` Keyword

The `this` keyword in JavaScript is a special identifier keyword that's automatically defined in the scope of every
function. It represents the context in which the current code is executing. The value of `this` depends on how the
function is called (its execution context), and it can vary between different parts of your code.

#### Global Context

- In the global execution context (outside of any function), `this` refers to the global object.
    - In a browser, the global object is `window`.
    - In Node.js, the global object is `global`.

  ```javascript
  console.log(this === window); // true in a browser
  ```

#### Function Context

1. **Regular Functions**:

- In regular function calls, `this` points to the global object (in non-strict mode) or `undefined` (in strict mode).

```javascript
   function show() {
    console.log(this);
}

show(); // `this` will be the global object or `undefined` in strict mode
```

2. **Method Calls**:

- When a function is called as a method of an object, `this` points to the object the method is called on.

```javascript
   const obj = {
    method: function () {
        console.log(this);
    }
};
obj.method(); // `this` refers to `obj`
```

#### Constructor Context

- When a function is used as a constructor with the `new` keyword, `this` refers to the newly created instance.

  ```javascript
  function Constructor() {
    this.a = 10;
  }
  const instance = new Constructor();
  console.log(instance.a); // 10
  ```

#### Arrow Functions

- Arrow functions do not have their own `this`. Instead, they inherit `this` from the parent scope at the time they are
  defined. This is particularly useful for callbacks.

  ```javascript
  const obj = {
    method: function() {
      return () => console.log(this);
    }
  };
  obj.method()(); // `this` inside the arrow function refers to `obj`
  ```

#### Explicit Binding

- Functions can have their `this` explicitly defined with methods like `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()`.

  ```javascript
  function show() {
    console.log(this);
  }

  const obj = {a: 10};
  show.call(obj); // `this` is explicitly set to `obj`
  show.apply(obj); // Similar to `call`, but for different argument handling
  const boundShow = show.bind(obj);
  boundShow(); // `this` is bound to `obj`
  ```

### Key Points to Remember

- The value of `this` is determined at runtime, based on the context in which the function is called.
- Regular functionsâ€™ `this` can vary, but arrow functions inherit `this` from their surrounding scope.
- The `new` keyword, method calls, and explicit binding with `call`, `apply`, or `bind` can all set the context
  of `this`.

The `this` keyword is a fundamental concept in JavaScript, providing flexibility and functionality in how functions
interact with objects and their properties. Understanding how `this` behaves in different contexts is crucial for
mastering JavaScript, especially for object-oriented programming and handling events.

## Callback Functions

Callback functions are a foundational concept in JavaScript, enabling asynchronous programming and allowing functions to
be executed after the completion of other operations. A callback function is a function passed into another function as
an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

#### Characteristics of Callback Functions

- **Asynchronous Execution**: Callbacks are often used for asynchronous operations, such as reading files, making HTTP
  requests, or waiting for user interactions, allowing the program to continue executing other code in the meantime.
- **Higher-order Functions**: Functions that accept callbacks are known as higher-order functions. They can manipulate
  or execute the callback functions.
- **Event Listeners**: One common use of callbacks is in event listeners, where the callback is executed in response to
  an event.

#### Example of a Callback Function

Consider an example where we use a callback to handle data after an asynchronous operation, like a simulated database
query:

```javascript
function fetchDataFromDatabase(query, callback) {
    setTimeout(() => { // Simulating a database operation with setTimeout
        const result = "data based on " + query;
        callback(result); // Invoking the callback with the result
    }, 1000); // Simulate delay
}

fetchDataFromDatabase("SELECT * FROM table", function (data) {
    console.log("Query result:", data);
});
```

In this example, `fetchDataFromDatabase` simulates fetching data from a database using `setTimeout`. It accepts a query
and a callback function. The callback function is called with the "fetched data" after a delay, simulating an
asynchronous operation. This pattern allows the program to continue running without waiting for the database operation
to complete, and the callback function handles the data once it's available.

#### Callbacks and Control Flow

While callbacks are powerful for handling asynchronous operations, they can lead to complex code structures known as "
callback hell" or "pyramid of doom," especially when multiple asynchronous operations depend on each other. Modern
JavaScript offers Promises and async/await syntax as alternatives to manage asynchronous code more cleanly.

 

Callback functions are a core concept in JavaScript, providing a way to execute functions asynchronously and handle
operations that take time to complete. They allow JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations, making it well-suited
for tasks that involve waiting for events or fetching data without freezing the user interface. Understanding how to use
callbacks effectively is essential for writing efficient and responsive JavaScript applications.

## Comparing `let`, `const`, and `var`

JavaScript offers three keywords for declaring variables: `var`, `let`, and `const`. These keywords differ in terms of
scope, hoisting behavior, and reassignment capabilities, impacting how and where variables can be used within your code.

### `var` vs `let` vs `const`

| Feature                | `var`                                                                                          | `let`                                                                                                           | `const`                                                                                                 |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scope**              | Function scope or global if declared outside any function.                                     | Block scope (limited to the block `{}` in which it is declared).                                                | Block scope (limited to the block `{}` in which it is declared).                                        |
| **Hoisting**           | Hoisted to the top of their scope. Only the declaration is hoisted, not the initialization.    | Hoisted to the top of their block, but not initialized (access before declaration results in a ReferenceError). | Same as `let`. Hoisted but not initialized, leading to a ReferenceError if accessed before declaration. |
| **Reassignment**       | Allows reassignment.                                                                           | Allows reassignment.                                                                                            | Does not allow reassignment.                                                                            |
| **Redeclaration**      | Allows redeclaration within the same scope.                                                    | Does not allow redeclaration within the same scope.                                                             | Does not allow redeclaration within the same scope.                                                     |
| **Temporal Dead Zone** | No temporal dead zone. Variables can be used before declaration but will return `undefined`.   | Exists from the start of the block until the declaration is reached.                                            | Exists, similar to `let`.                                                                               |
| **Initialization**     | Does not require initialization at the time of declaration.                                    | Does not require initialization at the time of declaration.                                                     | Requires initialization at the time of declaration.                                                     |
| **Use Case**           | Legacy way to declare variables. Generally replaced by `let` and `const` in modern JavaScript. | Use when the variable's value needs to change, or when its use is limited to a specific block of code.          | Use for declaring variables that should not be reassigned after their initial value is set.             |

#### Scope

- **`var`**: Declares a variable with function scope or global scope if declared outside a function. Variables declared
  with `var` can be accessed anywhere within the function in which they were declared, or throughout the global scope if
  declared outside a function.
- **`let` and `const`**: Introduce block scope for variables, which means the variable is confined to the block (denoted
  by `{}`) in which it is declared. This includes loops, conditionals, and other code blocks, providing finer control
  over the variable's visibility.

#### Hoisting

- **`var`**: Variables are hoisted to the top of their function or global scope, but only the declaration is hoisted,
  not the initialization. If accessed before the declaration, a `var` variable will result in `undefined`.
- **`let` and `const`**: Also hoisted to the top of their block scope, but they are not initialized. Accessing them
  before the declaration will cause a ReferenceError. This period from the start of the block until the declaration is
  known as the "temporal dead zone."

#### Reassignment and Redeclaration

- **`var`**: Allows for redeclaration and reassignment. This can lead to issues where variables are accidentally
  redeclared within the same scope, potentially leading to bugs.

  ```javascript
  var x = 1;
  var x = 2; // No error
  x = 3; // Reassignment is allowed
  ```

- **`let`**: Allows reassignment but does not allow redeclaration within the same scope. This helps avoid accidental
  redeclarations.

  ```javascript
  let y = 1;
  y = 2; // Reassignment is allowed
  // let y = 3; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'y' has already been declared
  ```

- **`const`**: Neither allows reassignment nor redeclaration. Once a `const` variable is assigned, its value (and
  binding) cannot be changed, making it useful for values that should not change after initialization.

  ```javascript
  const z = 1;
  // z = 2; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
  // const z = 3; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'z' has already been declared
  ```

It's important to note that while `const` prevents reassignment of the variable identifier, it does not make the value
it holds immutable. For example, if a `const` variable holds an object, the object's properties can still be modified.

#### Best Practices

- **Use `const` by default** for variables that should not be reassigned after their initial value is set.
- **Use `let`** for variables that need to be reassigned or are only relevant within a specific block of code.
- **Avoid `var`** in modern JavaScript to prevent issues related to function scope and hoisting, unless you have a
  specific reason or are working in an environment that does not support `let` and `const`.

Understanding the differences between `var`, `let`, and `const` is crucial for writing clear, effective, and predictable
JavaScript code. By using `let` and `const` appropriately, developers can avoid common pitfalls related to scope and
accidental redeclarations, leading to more maintainable and bug-free code.

## Promises in JavaScript

Promises in JavaScript represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting
value. They are used to handle asynchronous tasks such as API calls, file operations, or timers, allowing for cleaner
and more manageable code compared to traditional callback functions.

#### Key Concepts of Promises

- **States**: A Promise has three states:
    - **Pending**: The initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
    - **Fulfilled**: The operation completed successfully.
    - **Rejected**: The operation failed.

- **Executor Function**: When creating a Promise, you provide an executor function that takes two arguments: `resolve`
  and `reject`. These functions are used to resolve or reject the Promise, respectively.

- **Thenable**: Promises are "thenable," meaning they have a `.then()` method. This method takes two arguments: a
  success handler for the resolved state and an optional failure handler for the rejected state.

- **Chaining**: Promises can be chained to perform sequential asynchronous operations. The `.then()` method returns a
  new Promise, allowing for multiple asynchronous operations to be performed in sequence.

- **Error Handling**: Errors in Promises can be caught using the `.catch()` method, which is executed if a Promise is
  rejected or if an error is thrown in the executor function or in any of the `.then()` success handlers.

#### Example of Using a Promise

Let's look at a simple example to demonstrate how a Promise might be used to handle an asynchronous operation:

```javascript
// Creating a new Promise
const fetchData = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        try {
            // Simulate fetching data successfully
            const data = "Sample Data";
            resolve(data); // Resolves the Promise with "Sample Data"
        } catch (error) {
            reject(error); // Rejects the Promise if an error occurs
        }
    }, 1000); // Simulate a network request with setTimeout
});

// Consuming the Promise
fetchData
    .then((data) => {
        console.log(data); // Output: "Sample Data"
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error(error); // Handle any errors
    });
```

In this example, `fetchData` is a Promise that simulates a network request to fetch data. After a delay, it resolves
with some "Sample Data". The `.then()` method is used to log this data when the Promise is fulfilled, and `.catch()` is
used to handle any errors.

#### Advantages of Using Promises

- **Fluent and Readable Code**: Promises allow for asynchronous code that is closer to how you would write synchronous
  code, making it more readable and maintainable.
- **Error Handling**: With the use of `.catch()`, Promises provide a centralized way of handling errors in asynchronous
  code.
- **Composition and Chaining**: Promises can be easily composed and chained, allowing for complex sequences of
  asynchronous operations to be written in a clean and manageable way.

Promises are a powerful feature of JavaScript for managing asynchronous operations. They provide a robust way to handle
the asynchronous flow of data, errors, and can significantly improve the readability and maintainability of your code.
As part of modern JavaScript, understanding and using Promises is essential for developing complex applications.

## Event Loop in JavaScript

The event loop is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that plays a crucial role in handling asynchronous operations and
ensuring non-blocking execution. JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can only execute one piece of code at a time.
The event loop enables JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations by using callbacks, promises, and other
asynchronous mechanisms, despite its single-threaded nature.

#### How the Event Loop Works

1. **Call Stack**: The call stack is where JavaScript keeps track of the sequence of operations to execute. When a
   function is called, it's pushed onto the stack. When the function completes, it's popped off the stack.

2. **Event Queue**: Also known as the callback queue, this is where callbacks from asynchronous operations wait to be
   executed. When an asynchronous operation completes, its callback is added to the event queue.

3. **Event Loop**: The event loop continually checks whether the call stack is empty. When the call stack is empty, the
   event loop moves the first callback in the event queue to the call stack to be executed. This process repeats, with
   the event loop constantly monitoring the call stack and event queue.

#### Role in Asynchronous Operations

- **Non-Blocking I/O**: JavaScript can perform long-running I/O operations, such as network requests or file operations,
  without blocking the main thread. While these operations are processed in the background, the main thread continues to
  run, executing other tasks.

- **Concurrency Model**: The event loop, along with the Web APIs (in browsers) or C++ APIs (in Node.js), forms the basis
  of JavaScript's concurrency model. It allows JavaScript to handle a vast number of concurrent operations with a single
  call stack.

- **Timers**: Functions like `setTimeout` and `setInterval` are handled by the event loop. They're scheduled to run
  after a specified delay, allowing the execution of code at predetermined times.

#### Example to Illustrate the Event Loop

Consider the following code snippet:

```javascript
console.log('Start');

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Callback executed');
}, 0);

console.log('End');
```

Output:

```
Start
End
Callback executed
```

Even though the `setTimeout` callback has a delay of 0 milliseconds, it doesn't execute immediately after "Start"
because:

1. "Start" is logged first as it's directly on the call stack.
2. The `setTimeout` callback is an asynchronous operation, so it's placed in the Web APIs environment, not directly on
   the call stack.
3. "End" is logged as the next synchronous operation.
4. Once the call stack is clear, the event loop transfers the `setTimeout` callback from the event queue to the call
   stack, and "Callback executed" is logged.

The event loop is the core mechanism that allows JavaScript to execute asynchronous callbacks in a non-blocking manner,
despite being single-threaded. It ensures that the UI remains responsive and that server-side JavaScript can handle high
throughput by efficiently managing operations that would otherwise block execution. Understanding the event loop is
crucial for writing efficient, effective JavaScript applications.

## Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Code Execution

JavaScript's execution model can handle both synchronous and asynchronous operations. Understanding the difference
between these two types of execution is crucial for writing efficient and effective JavaScript applications, especially
given JavaScript's single-threaded nature.

#### Synchronous Execution

- **Sequential**: Synchronous code is executed in sequence, line by line. Each statement waits for the previous one to
  finish before executing.
- **Blocking**: If a synchronous operation takes time to complete (e.g., a complex calculation), it blocks further
  execution until it completes. This can lead to performance issues or unresponsive behavior in applications, especially
  in the UI.
- **Predictable**: The straightforward, top-to-bottom execution order makes synchronous code predictable and easier to
  follow.

**Example**: A simple loop printing numbers.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i); // This will block the execution until the loop completes.
}
console.log("Loop finished.");
```

#### Asynchronous Execution

- **Non-Blocking**: Asynchronous operations allow the code execution to continue without waiting for the operation to
  complete. This is particularly useful for operations that involve waiting, such as API requests, file operations, or
  timers.
- **Callbacks and Promises**: Asynchronous behavior is often handled using callbacks, promises, and `async/await`
  syntax. These mechanisms allow you to specify what should happen once the asynchronous operation completes.
- **Concurrency**: Despite JavaScript being single-threaded, asynchronous operations enable concurrent behavior, thanks
  to the event loop, which allows other code to run while waiting for asynchronous operations to complete.

**Example**: Using `setTimeout` to simulate asynchronous code.

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("This is asynchronous");
}, 1000); // Executes after a delay of 1000ms

console.log("End"); // Executes immediately, without waiting for the setTimeout
```

#### Key Differences

- **Execution Order**: Synchronous code runs in the order it appears, while asynchronous code may complete at a future
  tick of the event loop, allowing the code that follows to execute without waiting.
- **Performance and Responsiveness**: Asynchronous operations can improve the performance and responsiveness of
  applications, especially web and Node.js applications, by not blocking the thread.
- **Complexity**: Asynchronous code can introduce complexity due to its non-linear execution flow, necessitating careful
  management of callbacks, promises, or `async/await` to handle the execution order and error handling effectively.

The choice between synchronous and asynchronous execution depends on the task at hand. For operations that are
CPU-intensive or that must complete in a specific order, synchronous code is appropriate. For I/O operations or tasks
that involve waiting, asynchronous code is preferable to keep the application responsive. Understanding and correctly
applying both models are essential skills for JavaScript developers.

## Arrow Functions

Arrow functions, introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), offer a concise syntax for writing function expressions in
JavaScript. They are particularly useful for short functions and situations where preserving the lexical value of `this`
is needed.

#### Syntax of Arrow Functions

The syntax of arrow functions allows for shorter function expressions. Here's a comparison:

- **Regular Function Expression**:
  ```javascript
  const add = function(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  };
  ```

- **Arrow Function**:
  ```javascript
  const add = (a, b) => a + b;
  ```

For single-argument functions, the parentheses around the parameter can be omitted. If the function contains only a
return statement, the curly braces and the `return` keyword can be omitted as well.

#### Arrow Functions vs Regular Function Expressions

1. **`this` Binding**:
    - **Arrow Functions**: Automatically capture the `this` value of the enclosing context at the time they are defined,
      making them ideal for use as callbacks or within methods where you want to access the outer method's properties.
    - **Regular Functions**: Have their own `this` context based on how the function is called. This can lead to
      unexpected values of `this` when the function is used as a callback.

2. **Syntax**:
    - **Arrow Functions**: Provide a more concise syntax, especially for single-line functions.
    - **Regular Functions**: Require the `function` keyword, curly braces, and a `return` statement (for non-void
      functions).

3. **Constructor**:
    - **Arrow Functions**: Cannot be used as constructors and will throw an error if used with the `new` keyword.
    - **Regular Functions**: Can be used as constructors.

4. **Arguments Object**:
    - **Arrow Functions**: Do not have their own `arguments` object. The `arguments` object of the enclosing scope is
      accessible, however.
    - **Regular Functions**: Have their own `arguments` object, which provides a collection of all the arguments passed
      to the function.

5. **Method Definitions**:
    - **Arrow Functions**: Not recommended for defining object methods where you expect to access the object properties
      using `this`, due to their lexical `this` binding.
    - **Regular Functions**: Suitable for methods in objects where `this` refers to the object itself.

6. **Prototype Property**:
    - **Arrow Functions**: Do not have a `prototype` property.
    - **Regular Functions**: Have a `prototype` property, useful when defining a function with methods inherited by
      instances created with the `new` keyword.

Arrow functions provide a concise syntax and address common pitfalls associated with the `this` keyword in JavaScript,
making them a valuable addition to the language for certain use cases. However, understanding the differences between
arrow functions and regular function expressions is crucial for choosing the right one based on the context in which the
function is used.

### Use Cases for Arrow Functions vs. Regular Function Expressions

Given their differences, arrow functions and regular function expressions serve distinct purposes in JavaScript
development. Hereâ€™s a deeper look into when to use each based on their characteristics.

#### When to Use Arrow Functions

1. **Callbacks and Higher-order Functions**: Arrow functions are ideal for use with array methods
   like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, or as callbacks for asynchronous operations, thanks to their concise syntax.

```javascript
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
   const squares = numbers.map(n => n * n);
```

2. **Lexical `this`**: In event handlers or methods that need to access the parent's `this` context, arrow functions are
   preferred because they do not bind their own `this`.

```javascript
   class Counter {
    constructor() {
        this.count = 0;
        setInterval(() => this.count++, 1000); // `this` refers to the Counter instance
    }
   }
```

3. **Functional Programming**: Due to their concise syntax, arrow functions are a good fit for functional programming
   patterns where functions are frequently passed as arguments or returned as values.

#### When to Use Regular Function Expressions

1. **Object Methods**: For methods defined in an object literal, regular function expressions are suitable because they
   can access the object instance through `this`.

```javascript
   const obj = {
    value: 1,
    increment: function () {
        this.value++;
        return this.value;
    }
   };
```

2. **Constructor Functions**: When defining a function that will be used as a constructor, regular function expressions
   are necessary because arrow functions cannot be used with `new`.

```javascript
   function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
   }

   Person.prototype.sayName = function () {
    console.log(this.name);
   };
   const person = new Person("Alice");
```

3. **Event Handlers**: In scenarios where you rely on the `event` object or need the `this` binding to the element that
   triggered the event, regular function expressions may be more appropriate.

```javascript
   document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function (event) {
    this.classList.toggle("active"); // `this` refers to the element, `myButton`
   });
```

4. **Functions Requiring `arguments`**: If you need to access the `arguments` object, a regular function expression
   provides direct access to it, unlike arrow functions which do not have their own `arguments`.

```javascript
   function concatenate() {
    return Array.prototype.join.call(arguments, '-');
   }
```

Choosing between arrow functions and regular function expressions in JavaScript depends on the specific needs of your
code, especially concerning `this` binding, the use of `new` for constructor functions, method definitions within
objects, and the readability of your code. Arrow functions offer a concise and elegant syntax suitable for many
situations but have limitations that make regular function expressions the better choice in others. Understanding these
nuances ensures that you can leverage the strengths of each function type effectively in your JavaScript projects.

## ECMAScript 6 (ES6)

ECMAScript 6, also known as ES6 or ECMAScript 2015, introduced several new features and enhancements to JavaScript.
These changes significantly improved the language's functionality and readability. Let's explore some of the key
features:

### 1. **Let and Const Declarations**

- **`let`**: Introduced block-scoped variables, which helped avoid issues with variable hoisting.
- **`const`**: Allowed the declaration of constants, which cannot be reassigned after initialization.

Example:

```javascript
   let x = 10;
const PI = 3.14159;
```

### 2. **Arrow Functions**

- Provided a concise syntax for defining functions, making code more readable.

Example:

```javascript
   const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

### 3. **Template Literals**

- Allowed string interpolation and multi-line strings with backticks (\`...\`).

Example:

```javascript
   const name = 'John';
console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
```

### 4. **Destructuring Assignment**

- Simplified extracting values from arrays and objects.

Example:

```javascript
   const [first, second] = [1, 2];
const {name, age} = {name: 'Alice', age: 30};
```

### 5. **Default Parameters**

- Enabled the definition of default values for function parameters.

Example:

```javascript
   function greet(name = 'Guest') {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

### 6. **Spread and Rest Operators**

- **Spread (`...`)**: Spread elements of an array or object into another array or object.
- **Rest (`...`)**: Gather function arguments into an array.

Example:

```javascript
   const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [...arr1, 4, 5];

function sum(...numbers) {
    return numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
}
```

### 7. **Classes**

- Introduced a more straightforward way to create and work with classes and constructor functions.

Example:

```javascript
   class Person {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    sayHello() {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);
    }
}
```

### 8. **Modules**

- Brought native support for module imports and exports, improving code organization.

Example (export):

```javascript
   // math.js
export const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

Example (import):

```javascript
   // app.js
import {add} from './math.js';
```

### 9. **Promises**

- Simplified handling of asynchronous operations, making it easier to manage callbacks.

Example:

```javascript
   function fetchData() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        // Asynchronous code here
        if (success) {
            resolve(data);
        } else {
            reject(error);
        }
    });
}
```

### 10. **Symbol**

- Introduced a new primitive data type for creating unique, non-enumerable object properties.

Example:

```javascript
   const uniqueKey = Symbol('description');
```

These are just some of the many features ES6 brought to JavaScript, enhancing its capabilities and making it more
powerful and developer-friendly.

### 11. **Iterators and Generators**

- ES6 introduced the `Symbol.iterator` and generator functions for creating iterable objects and simplifying
  asynchronous control flow.

Example (Iterable):

```javascript
   const iterableObject = {
    [Symbol.iterator]: function* () {
        yield 1;
        yield 2;
        yield 3;
    }
};
```

Example (Generator):

```javascript
   function* generateNumbers() {
    yield 1;
    yield 2;
    yield 3;
}
```

### 12. **Map and Set Data Structures**

- ES6 added `Map` and `Set` data structures for efficient key-value pairs and unique values management.

Example (Map):

```javascript
   const map = new Map();
map.set('name', 'Alice');
```

Example (Set):

```javascript
   const uniqueNumbers = new Set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]);
```

### 13. **Enhanced Object Literals**

- Improved syntax for defining object properties and methods.

Example:

```javascript
   const firstName = 'John';
const lastName = 'Doe';
const person = {
    firstName,
    lastName,
    sayHello() {
        console.log(`Hello, ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}!`);
    }
};
```

### 14. **Async/Await**

- Simplified handling of asynchronous code using `async` functions and `await` keyword.

Example:

```javascript
   async function fetchData() {
    try {
        const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
        const data = await response.json();
        return data;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error:', error);
    }
}
```

### 15. **Proxy and Reflect**

- ES6 introduced the `Proxy` object for customizing object behavior and the `Reflect` object for performing
  meta-programming operations.

Example (Proxy):

```javascript
   const handler = {
    get(target, prop) {
        return `Getting property: ${prop}`;
    }
};
const proxyObj = new Proxy({}, handler);
```

These are some additional features introduced in ES6, enhancing JavaScript's capabilities in various aspects, from
syntax improvements to better handling of asynchronous code and data structures. Embracing ES6 has become standard
practice in modern JavaScript development, enabling more efficient and readable code.

## Strict Mode

Strict mode is a feature in JavaScript introduced in ECMAScript 5 (ES5) that allows you to opt into a stricter set of
rules and error-checking mechanisms. When you enable strict mode within a script or a function, the JavaScript
interpreter becomes more vigilant about catching and reporting common coding mistakes and "unsafe" actions. Here's an
explanation of the concept and its benefits:

### Enabling Strict Mode:

To enable strict mode, simply add the following line at the top of your JavaScript file or within a function:

```javascript
"use strict";
```

Alternatively, you can enable strict mode for a specific function:

```javascript
function myFunction() {
    "use strict";
    // Function code in strict mode
}
```

### Benefits of Strict Mode:

1. **Catch Silent Errors:**
    - Strict mode catches silent errors and turns them into explicit exceptions. For example, assigning a value to an
      undeclared variable or using reserved keywords as variable names will result in errors.

2. **Prevent Global Variables:**
    - In non-strict mode, omitting the `var`, `let`, or `const` keyword when declaring a variable inside a function
      creates a global variable. Strict mode prevents this accidental creation of global variables.

3. **Disallow Octal Syntax:**
    - Octal syntax (e.g., `0123`) is disallowed in strict mode. In non-strict mode, it would be treated as a decimal
      number, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

4. **This Binding:**
    - In strict mode, the `this` keyword behaves differently. It is not automatically bound to the global object (
      e.g., `window` in a web browser), which can help avoid unintended context errors.

5. **Restrictions on `arguments` and `eval`:**
    - In strict mode, the `arguments` object is not linked to parameter changes, and the `eval` function has its own
      lexical scope. This prevents potential issues related to these constructs.

6. **Assignment to Immutable Global Objects:**
    - Strict mode disallows assignments to some global objects that should not be modified, such as `undefined`, `NaN`,
      and `Infinity`.

7. **Deletion of Variables and Functions:**
    - Deleting variables, functions, or function arguments is not allowed in strict mode. This can help prevent
      accidental data loss.

8. **Duplicated Parameter Names:**
    - Strict mode prohibits the use of duplicate parameter names in function declarations, making it easier to avoid
      naming conflicts.

### Example:

```javascript
"use strict";

function exampleStrictMode() {
    // Silent error: variable assignment without declaration
    undeclaredVar = 10; // Throws an error in strict mode

    // Duplicate parameter names
    function duplicateParams(param1, param1) { // Throws an error in strict mode
        // Function code
    }

    // Deleting variables is not allowed
    var a = 42;
    delete a; // Throws an error in strict mode
}

exampleStrictMode();
```

In summary, strict mode in JavaScript enhances code quality and helps catch common programming mistakes and ambiguities
at an early stage, reducing the likelihood of subtle bugs and making your code more reliable and maintainable. It is
recommended to use strict mode in all your JavaScript projects to benefit from its advantages.
